#### AI Architecture and Strategy
![AI Architecture and Strategy](https://www.marshcommercial.co.uk/-/media/marsh-commercial/articles/data-and-cyber-risks/icaew-ai-web-article-banner.png?mw=1500&hash=BC39BFBBB40816F2B7AC049D2A67299D)

I thrive at the intersection of AI and Medicine, and I enjoy advising health companies on AI implementation and the strategy involved. 

I rarely work on Github directly, but I've uploaded some of my non-proprietary repos. Feel free to check out!

I teach Deep Learning in Medicine to graduate students at Stanford. 

Skills: Python / C++ / R / TensorFlow / PyTorch / Keras
